# CodeWars Kata: Human readable duration format

I just solved my first 4 kyu kata in CodeWars. Messy code as usual, but it worked.
Had to search quite a lot online for a way to format the fstrings (excluding zeros, pluralisation, etc). Formatting is definitly not my strongest skill for now.

**Positives:**
  - Awareness: I noticed when I was repeating the code too much, and am aware that those repetitive blocks need some work, but I was focused on getting the program to do what I wanted for now, regardless of good design

## Reflections:
✨I often feel that some deeper Math knowledge would help a lot.

✨I feel I get "smarter" after every exercise I solve. I builds up.

✨I suppose I will eventually be able to organise my code better with practice.
